    <h1>Bananaaaaas</h1>
<p>20 Aug 2018 - jill</p>

<p>A banana is an edible fruit <em>botanically a berry</em> produced by several kinds
of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.</p>

<p>In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called <strong>plantains</strong>,
distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size, color,
and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in
starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown
when ripe.</p>
